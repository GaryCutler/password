# Generate a random password 

## steps to edit code
1. I created a prompt for how many charcters we need 
2. I alerted the user if what they selected was invalid 

3. I created confirm slections for the user to select from for Lowercase, Uppercase, numbers, and special characters 

4. my next step will be validating the code 

5. create a randomize password using the users inputs
